[**AfricaCodeWeek**](https://africacodeweek.org/) is an initiative by **SAP** for digital skill development in Africa. The initiative has benefitted millions of Africans and is openly supported by **UNESCO** along with 130 partners.

Being an SAP employee, I got the opportunity to deliver a session on **Computation Thinking** and **Coding with Scratch** to African teachers. I had to take this session keeping in mind that these teachers are in-turn going to teach the same to their students. We were trained beforehand to take examples that will be easy for these teachers to make their students understand. 

It was a two and a half hour ZOOM call session which was divided into two sections:
1. Computational Thinking
2. Coding with Scratch

**Computational Thinking**
>Before directly jumping to coding, I explained how to develop computation thinking to approach any problem. I took real life examples to explain following subtopics:
>- Decomposition
>- Pattern Recognition
>- Abstraction
>- Algorithm

**Coding with Scratch**
>Then I took a hands on coding session where I taught beginner level coding with the help of [SCRATCH](https://scratch.mit.edu), a tool built by MIT for beginners. First I introduced them to the various aspects of the tool and later did three coding exercises with them of increasing difficulty. There were lot of smart queries that came up during the exercise which made the session quite interactive and interesting.


Here are some glimpse of the session:

Overall it was a wonderful experience and I felt quite positive after delivering the session. I would definitely involve myself more in such social activities in future as it fills you with positive energy and a sense of satisfaction.
